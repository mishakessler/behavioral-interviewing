## General Tips

### Preparation

Do your homework! You should walk into an interview knowing as much as you can about the company, the interviewer, and the position.

### Active Listening

While interviewing, it's easy to get nervous and overthink what our next response will be, so be attentive and remember the keys to active listening: 

1. **Pay attention.** Take a moment between their commentary and your response. Use body language to convey attentiveness, such as eye contact and nodding. When using video chats, look directly at their video; hide your self-view if necessary.
2. **Withhold judgment or assumptions.** Listen for points that may conflict with your assumptions about the position.
3. **Reflect and clarify.** Paraphrase talking points that stood out to you and provide clarifying questions, such as, "If I understood you correctly... it sounds like you feel... What do you think about... Can you expound on this point?"
4. **Summarize.** Restate key points and themes from their point of view, framing your intention and asking if you missed anything, such as, "To make sure I understand, my takeaway is... Did I get that right?"

## Common Questions
### "Tell me about yourself."

This question often leads to a trap of long-winded, rambling exposÃ©s regarding our personal and professional life. To avoid this, before answering this question, ask for a more complete description of the role and responsibilities, which will allow to you tailor your answer to your interviewers' priorities. For example:

> "I have a rather robust professional history and a number of accomplishments I would like to share, but I want to make the best use of our time together and speak directly to my relevant experience. To help me do that, could you tell me more about what you believe to be the biggest priorities of this position?"

Using tenets of active listening, it helps to drill down into the interviewers core wants and needs, and only then can you effectively highlight the personal and professional experience that will feel relevant and important to acknowledge during your limited time.
